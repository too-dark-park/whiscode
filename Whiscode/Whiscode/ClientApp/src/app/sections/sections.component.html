      <p>I have experience with many different front-end technologies. As well as the expected HTML / HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, other skills include jQuery, Bootstrap, SASS/LESS (with an understanding of BEM and SMACSS methodology), AngularJS and Angular 9.

      <p>My version control of choice is Git but I have commercial experience with Bitbucket, Subversion and Azure DevOps Server / TFS.</p>
      <p>I have integrated many third-party applications. This includes payment services (Worldpay, Paypal, GoCredit and Adyen), Google APIs, Vimeo, Google Tag Manager and Twilio.</p>
